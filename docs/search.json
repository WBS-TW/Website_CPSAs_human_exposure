The website will be communicated to relevant stakeholders and other researchers through our networks and social media.\n\n\nThe use of the R package Quarto and Github pages makes it easy to create and maintain websites without hiring external web designers or website hotels. We aim to continue maintaining the website even after the project end to make the website a knowledge base for CPs research (or add other future funded projects in this topic).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject overview and work packages"
